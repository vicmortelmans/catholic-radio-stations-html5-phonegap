Flashcard webapp using HTML5 and ready for conversion to native app through phonegap for offline use.

Forking this app for your own content is easy:

1/ update index.html
    - your <title>
    - your <h1> on the navigation page
    - translation of some button strings (now: Dutch)

2/ provide your own qa.json file 
    - I have the questions-and-answers stored in a Google Spreadsheet:
      https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Au659FdpCliwdGlmLU9VcnJyQ2FQZGtEUnREdnZSZmc&usp=sharing
    - I use this Google script to export this data to JSON:
